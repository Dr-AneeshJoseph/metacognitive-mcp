Conceptual Foundations:

This project draws on concepts from:
- Epistemology (justified true belief, defeaters, calibration)
- Cognitive science (dual-process theory, cognitive biases)
- Formal logic (valid inference, fallacy theory)
- Software engineering (invariant-based design, separation of concerns)
